## Status


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cbuteau/listOfLists.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cbuteau/listOfLists)



## Concept

The need for multiple shutdown lists of links in tabs.

You take a bunch of tags and give it a name.
It you call up your list of names and open them.

Need better graphics for the buttons.
